# Temperature effects on the leech T cell
The project was aimed at analyzing temperature effects on the mechanosensory Touch (T) cell in the leech. The analysis focuses on spike latencies and the timing of spikes from two different spike inititation zones. This repository contains the analysis scripts and functions written in Matlab. They can be used to analyze specific electrophysiological data that belong to this project. 

The according datasets are part of a published paper and can be found at https://gin.g-node.org/Computational_Neuroscience_UOL/Scherer_et_al_2023 in /raw data/Cooled_newFormat and /raw data/RoomTemp_newFormat.
